# Gin

A Git inspired client for Subversion.

## Why?

At work, we build new functionality in feature branches. With Subversion, this often means fiddling with repo URLs to create a branch or several commands in order to merge a branch back.

Outside of work many of us use `git`, so creating a similar command line DSL makes sense.

## Usage

Change into the root of your check out and call `gin` as you would `git`.

    gin <command>

For example, check out the trunk of `myproject` and list the branches:

    svn checkout http://repo.com/path/to/myproject/trunk myproject
    cd myproject
    gin branch

## Project structure

Our projects follow this directory convention:

    projectName/
        branches/
            some-branch/
            another-branch/
        trunk/

Projects are checked out at either `trunk` or a directory under `branches`.

## Documentation

See the [manual](https://github.com/richardhodgson/gin/blob/master/MANUAL.md).

## Why don't you just use Git?

It's complicated.

## Why don't you just use Gitsvn?

That's more complicated. Whilst that means we can use Git locally, we'd still have to push back to the Subversion repo eventually. I'd rather just use Subversion, however I do like the Git command line API.

## Why is it named gin?

Its only one letter different than `git` and I like gin.
